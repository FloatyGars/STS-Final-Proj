        <h2>Following Orders vs. Protecting Users</h2>

        <p><strong>By:</strong> Edrol Bueno</p>

        <h3>What is the dilemma?</h3>
        <p>
            A software engineer at a tech company discovers a serious security vulnerability in a newly developed mobile
            application that handles sensitive user data, including personal information, financial details, and login
            credentials. If exploited, this flaw could expose thousands of users to identity theft, financial loss, or
            privacy violations.  The management, under pressure to meet strict deadlines and launch the app ahead of competitors, instructs
            engineers not to report the vulnerability publicly and to proceed with the release. The
            engineer faces a conflict between professional ethics and loyalty to management.
            Following orders may preserve the engineer’s job and workplace harmony but endangers users’ information.
            Reporting the vulnerability protects users but risks professional consequences.
        </p>

        <h3>Choices</h3>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Choice 1:</strong> Follow management directives — Release the app on schedule despite knowing the vulnerability exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 2:</strong> Report the problem internally and insist on resolution — Inform management and advocate for fixing the issue before release, even if it delays the launch.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 3:</strong> Document the vulnerability and plan a post-release patch — Inform the security team, release the app, and provide a patch shortly after to address the issue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compromises per Choice</h3>

        <h4>Choice 1 (Follow management directives):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Job secured; deadlines are met.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> User safety and professional ethics are compromised.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 2 (Report and insist on resolution):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Users are fully protected; ethical responsibilities upheld.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Deadlines may be delayed; potential tension with management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 3 (Document and plan post-release patch):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Balances ethical responsibilities with practical concerns; users are protected eventually; deadlines are met. <em>This is the most balanced and pragmatic choice.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Some users may face minor risks before the patch is applied; relies on prompt post-release action.</li>
        </ul>
