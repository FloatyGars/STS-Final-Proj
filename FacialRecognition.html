        <h2>Facial Recognition and Surveillance</h2>

        <p><strong>By:</strong> Emmanuel Cerafica and Vienn Yzabel Babasa</p>

        <h3>What is the dilemma?</h3>
        <p>
            The ethical dilemma surrounding facial recognition and surveillance technology comes from the conflict between ensuring public safety and protecting individual privacy. 
            While it can help law enforcement identify criminals, locate missing persons, and enhance security, this technology also enables mass surveillance and data collection without people’s consent. 
            This raises multiple concerns about the right to privacy, potential misuse of data, and the accuracy of the technology especially since studies have shown it can be biased against certain groups. 
            The core issue lies in deciding whether it is acceptable to sacrifice personal freedom and anonymity in exchange for increased safety and convenience.
        </p>

        <h3>Choices</h3>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Choice 1:</strong> Fully use Facial Recognition Technology — Allow the widespread use of facial recognition technology in public areas, law enforcement, and private organizations to enhance safety and efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 2:</strong> Restrict or regulate Facial Recognition use — Allow facial recognition only in specific, justified cases with strict rules, consent, and oversight to protect privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 3:</strong> Completely ban Facial Recognition Technology — Prohibit the use of facial recognition in public and private settings to fully protect individuals’ rights and privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compromises per Choice</h3>

        <h4>Choice 1 (Fully use Facial Recognition Technology):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Improves safety and efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Sacrifices personal privacy; increases the risk of surveillance abuse and data misuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 2 (Restrict or regulate Facial Recognition use):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Balances privacy and security through strict oversight.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Reduces efficiency and may slow law enforcement operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 3 (Completely ban Facial Recognition Technology):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Protects individual privacy and freedom; addresses major ethical and civil liberty concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Loses potential security and technological benefits that facial recognition offers.</li>
        </ul>
