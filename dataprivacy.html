        <h2>Data Privacy vs. Safety</h2>

        <p><strong>By:</strong> Tara Nicole Arada</p>

        <h3>What is the dilemma?</h3>
        <p>
            The ethical dilemma surrounding data privacy comes from the tension between protecting individual rights and
            ensuring safety or efficiency. Organizations collect, store, and use personal data for various purposes,
            such
            as improving services, tracking trends, or ensuring security. While this can benefit society, it raises
            concerns about misuse, unauthorized access, and the potential violation of personal privacy. The core issue
            is
            deciding whether it is acceptable to compromise privacy in order to achieve safety, convenience, or
            technological progress.
        </p>

        <h3>Choices</h3>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Choice 1:</strong> Users refuse to share data — Users can choose not to provide personal
                information, limiting the amount of data collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 2:</strong> Organizations are transparent about data usage — Organizations clearly
                disclose how user data is collected, stored, and used, giving users more control and awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice 3:</strong> Display user agreements before data collection — Provide clear and accessible
                agreements detailing privacy policies, rights, and responsibilities before data is collected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compromises per Choice</h3>

        <h4>Choice 1 (Users refuse to share data):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Complete protection from data breaches or misuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Organizations lack essential information, reducing the effectiveness of
                services, safety measures, or innovations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 2 (Organizations are transparent about data usage):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Users can track and understand how their data is used, fostering trust and
                accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Transparency may still expose sensitive information and increase the
                potential for breaches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 3 (Display user agreements before data collection):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Users are informed of their rights and consent, promoting ethical and legal
                compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Many users may ignore agreements, limiting their practical effectiveness
                in protecting privacy.</li>
        </ul>
