        <h2>Ethical Dilemma: Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Hiring and Recruitment</h2>

        <p><strong>By:</strong> Keanne Quicoy</p>

        <h3>What is the dilemma?</h3>
        <p>
            The question here is about the digitised recruitment process vs. using the conventional human way of recruiting through interviews, etc. 
            Most companies appear to be going for the first alternative, though not all companies rely entirely on AI tools for recruitment. 
            Instead, they might be employing the technology to screen resumes, conduct video interviews, and handle preliminary selection while still leaving human supervision for the final decisions. 
            The dilemma is that they might be unintentionally excluding specific groups (men, women, minorities, etc.) even though their intention was to promote efficiency or reduce human bias. 
            How should companies react? Prioritize efficiency and scale or fairness and human supervision?
        </p>

        <h3>Choices</h3>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Continue using AI systems in hiring for faster and data-driven decisions.</li>
            <li>Limit or stop using AI tools in recruitment and rely more on human evaluation.</li>
            <li>Use AI only as a supportive tool, while keeping human recruiters as the main decision-makers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compromises per Choice</h3>

        <h4>Choice 1 (Continue using AI):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Time-saving, better control of some human errors or biases, large application handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Promotes hidden algorithmic biases; disadvantages some groups unfairly; no transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 2 (Limit/Stop AI):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> More human judgment and supervision; possibly fairer results for diverse candidates.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Slower process; more expensive; human bias still exists; hard to scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choice 3 (AI as support only):</h4>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Good balance—efficiency + human supervision; checks are possible on AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More training needed for recruiters; monitoring costs; still partly depends on possibly flawed AI tools.</li>
        </ul>
